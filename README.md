"BGLScene" is an OpenGL ES scene graph library I created during development of the game
[Fingerpaintball][fpb]. Although it was designed to be a general purpose library, I only
added functionality as I needed it for the game I was working on. In other words, don't
be surprised if functionality that "obviously" belongs in a scene graph library is
missing.
